# Color-Selector
A program to select any color on your desktop or web browser.

Introduction:
This was a simple project to grab any color you see on your desktop or in an open window. I made this because I'm always seeing colors that I would like use in the future; but to do that I need their RGB data. Simply click the color you want to know of and the program will display it to you. It can hold up to 5 colors and can be reset. The program will also display the x and y coordinates of the spot you grabbed the colors from.

How to use:
Press 'enter' to start selecting.
Left-click any specific spots on your display that you would like to see the RGB values of.
Press 'enter' again to stop it.
Press 'space' to display your selected values.
Press 'backspace to wipe them.

I hope you enjoy using my program and if you see any changes that can be made to make it better then go for it.
